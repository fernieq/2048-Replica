Program Description: for this PA, our main purpose is to let the players to have
the opportunity to play the actual 2048 game on the screen! With that being said,
I mean we have created ways to make the tiles colorful, with each tile has its 
accordingly number. We can also check the current score on the screen. Bascially,
we have made it possible to visualize the game instead of just making it merely
funtional.The way to accomplish this goal is to treat each little tile of the 
game single element, and we want to put all these small pieces together and show
them on a literal stage which allows the players to see the game.Every time we 
press the arrow keys, we also need to make sure we update the tiles and the 
score correctly! And if the player decides to quit the game, he can simply press
"S" key to quit the game!
